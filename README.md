# Project Description

This is my assignment project at Udacity, [Intro to Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd000). In a 2~4 month period, I'll be updating this repo and submit the files for review.

## Stage 1 Submission
> In this stage, you will use two languages, HTML and CSS, to create a web page to store your notes for the Nanodegree.

**Submission Dated**:      02/13/2015  
**Assessment**:            Did Not Meet Specifications  
**File Reviewed**:         index.html  
						   css/style.css  
**Reviewer Feedback**:  


## Stage 2 Submission
> In this stage, you will use the Python programming language to automatically generate the HTML code for your web page. This will let you quickly and easily add new notes to your page without having to unnecessarily rewrite any code.

## Stage 3 Submission
>In this stage, you will use code that's already been written by other programmers to embed YouTube videos directly into your web page.

## Stage 4 Submission
>In this stage you will put your web page online and set up a server so that users who visit your page can add notes of their own (if you let them of course).

## Stage 5 Submission
>In this stage, you will gain exposure to many new ideas in programming and then choose what you want to learn and build next.
