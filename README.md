# Project Description

This is my assignment project at Udacity, [Intro to Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd000). In a 2~4 month period, I'll be updating this repo and submit the files for review.

[Stage 1 Submission](#stage-1-submission) | [Stage 2 Submission](#stage-2-submission) | [Stage 3 Submission](#stage-3-submission) | [Stage 4 Submission](#stage-4-submission) | [Stage 5 Submission](#stage-5-submission)

## Stage 1 Submission
> In this stage, you will use two languages, HTML and CSS, to create a web page to store your notes for the Nanodegree.

    <ul>
      <li> Commenting out the CSS styling without explanation is not the best practice. It's hard for other developers or yourself in the future to figure out if the commented code should be kept or not.</li>
      <li> Understand the HTML aggreement. Putting <em>h1</em> under each and every of your <em>article</em> is going to confuse the web crawler.</li>
    </ul>

  <dt>Reviewer Feedback</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li> p tags should not be used for headings. It would be better to use a h1 or h2, or just a div for these and then style them how you like by making them a class.</li>  
      <li> There is some weird character encodings where you put different inverted commas, such as on line 35 in index.html.</li>  
      <li>The final code example 'Appending and Adding' could use a little more explanation, as to why append and + and += are different ie say that r = r + 1 is the same as writing r += 1, that it is just a shortcut.</li>
      <li>Text inside a paragraph tag is better indented to make your code clearer</li>
      <li>Some whitespace between the end of a section in your code and the beginning of the next one would also make it clearer! :)</li>  
      <li>On README.md: A little more explanation here would be useful! For example, a description of the main files for the project! :)</li> 
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>My Response</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated README.md to explain the project and it's progress</li>
      <li>Updated index.md according to the feedback.</li>

## Stage 2 Submission
> In this stage, you will use the Python programming language to automatically generate the HTML code for your web page. This will let you quickly and easily add new notes to your page without having to unnecessarily rewrite any code.

## Stage 3 Submission
>In this stage, you will use code that's already been written by other programmers to embed YouTube videos directly into your web page.

## Stage 4 Submission
>In this stage you will put your web page online and set up a server so that users who visit your page can add notes of their own (if you let them of course).

## Stage 5 Submission
>In this stage, you will gain exposure to many new ideas in programming and then choose what you want to learn and build next.
